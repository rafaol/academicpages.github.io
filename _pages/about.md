Research interests
---
Rafael's current research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for problems stemming from 
planning under uncertainty and Bayesian inference. In particular, he has been working with Bayesian optimisation, 
Gaussian processes, approximate inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In terms of applications, his
work has been addressing problems in robotics and geoscience. More detailed information is available at the
